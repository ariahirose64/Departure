# Departure
I think ive been debating this for quite a few years (pre gigaleak for reference) how ever to keep it short i took a abrupt break for about a month with little to no explanation, no im not dead in a ditch. no im not going to take down every repo ive ever made in some pycho tiffy fit, slander countless people ect. its really was a long time comming that should have happened a while ago.


it is no secret that a bit before gigaleak i joined a studio ive been vauge about because nintendo fans are very hostile towards former modders and at the end of the day i like reverse engineering code and creating new experiences.
however around the time decomps were starting people have lost sight of what actually mattered (i dont think 3rd quest ever realized what mattered tbf)
when i mod a game i have a goal, make an experience that brings joy to people. that should be the litteral only thing that matters.
in all honesty in modern times people are free to do what they want when they play but the modern consensus is to try to eliminate as many games and mods that dont meet a very very specific criteria. that criteria is no longer "whats fun" or "that made me laugh"
modern times seems to be "what thing from other game can i bring into oot" or "how can i teriform the game into not being ot" my "favorite" is" how can we put as many speed running tricks can  we put in so we can force the player to skip the shitty parts"

the final straw can be described as bikeshedding
the general theme is "bike shedding"
i will also explain the phrase as people dont know what it means and a valid phrase has been reduced to ehat ever the fuck people think is annoying
The term "bikeshedding" originates from C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 book, Parkinson's Law: The Pursuit of Progress
it describes the intense focus on bikes in a bikeshed when the job at hand is to maintain a nuclear reactor.
the term bike shedding refers to focusing on very unimportant details when there are far more important thing to worry about

the main issue was i found out that pret, a pokemon community full of people that (to put things lightly) are some ofb= the most clinically insane people i have ever met, sold out the entire emulation community to leak proprietary source code. even worse the main way they also tried to implicate the ocarina of time community was this
they knew that despite the oot's colorful attitude the (former) community took even the slightest implication of illegal code theft very seriously. the entire reason zzconvert was even coindidered is because we wanted to absolutly know that the stack was entirely clean room. it was to the point that development was even fractured so 0 people had everything. i know this because i worked on the stack.

in order to implicate the oot community many steps steps were taken.

- The leaked code was specifically damaged to only include files already decomped. this was an attempt to try to "prove" oot used stolen code.

- Mass Slander of members that would not go with the idea of working with leaked code

- Removal of ancient contributers (since litteral zso days) in order to destabilize the project

- There was already a big mistake in this.

1) they sent members links to the leak way too short notice to do reputational damage.

2) They decided to slander every member that took a public stance with noticing commits that allegidly had leaked code inside i dont think there was a single case in support.

3) Slandering specifically me unknowing i was a huge part of the ordeal over a seperate uncident of athem bullying an autistic person (who 0 people are debating hes fucking annoying btw) essentially creating another layer of obvious bikeshedding.

during this time there was additional bikeshedding over variable names in this project and there was one more peoice of the puzzle that may or may not even be realated but i am mentioning tem below to give all the information, anything with an asterisk all be in this category

* z64 convert had a hostile take over, it was given to a person that earned flotonics trust (which he admits was a mistake)
the project was given to a person known to be hostile to the project and every single memeber that created it including myself though i had 0 knowlage of any of this until a week before the endgame. the fork had added features that progressively broke things almost strategically, very few impottant updates were made to the point it was unmaintainable. as a founding mamber i had 0 idea the scope but i heard bits and peices. when it was announced it the repo would be deleted not archived deleted and the git history was wiped it was absolutlely clear that there was an effort to sestroy zelda modding.

* when i switched to a soft fork of decomp i was givin co repo ownership. though i didnt commit much i was monitoring commits as i was supicious. and then my commits were wiped a rebase that killed features were gone and commits that would make sense for a fork that wasnt in control of decomp suddenly had full control. i ended up leaving however i was compiling data, taking notes and sicussing things privately. it was odd.

* after a bit i started getting alligations that i did somthing horrible but i was told i was crazy or that i was a neo nazi, the irony is that my step grad father quite litteraly was ant nazi by occupation to the point its impossible to claim otherwise (he was a litteral medic that seen combat in major battles and lived to tell the tale, and given i met him irl he lived until 90+)

the absurdity was getting rediculous and with acceptance of legitimate major console manufacturer deals my patience was wearing thin as if this kept up internally (on the pro side) i couldnt keep shut for longer as this was becoming an active attempt to make an already upset game industy fo on the war path. also i do not want talk about contaversies like sweet baby but i will say one thing, i went out of my way to avoid them (both speaking and the company themselves for flaringly obvious reasons, im am aware). but the consern was i dint want to be a mole on either side so this eventually just had me quit. there was an insane ammount of bs and with me haveing 0 future in a community that kinda hated me and was too dumb to realize it was destoying itself i removed myself. the day i did i was going to dump the info however the mere metion fo gigaleak caused a fight that if i told the modding side the full scope they would do every thing in there power to try to report me to partner companies they have 0 idea i already had ant i was specifically trying to prevent a clusterfuck. at that point it is too far gone. depite the people not being retarded it was clear they were too stupid to save themselves.

# aftermath

the old github was rendered inaccessable due to github's end. my account was not breached however the authentication token was corrupted.  i deirectly proved that i had access to the email offered irrifutable proof i was the repo owner by opewning up repos that were private and providing fit meta data that could not be faked inside the repo using the email associated with the account and shoewing them i still had the token backed up itself. github stupidly requires 2fa other than ssh or tgp that requires a device i dont own on purpose, a cell phone. my work around was to use gnome authenticator however i confirmed this was not a gnome bug as the same key was in at least 3 backups. this was 100% githubs fault and has cost me at least 1400 usd in lost profit. im not seeking legal as partly i was warned of this inebitability and im partly negligent ruining a case against a multi billion dollar company i also have contracts with. it litteraly would be retarded of me to sue. however i will not be using git other than to acess artifacts of repos. using it for real dev has already cost me money.

after my deletinon of all accounts the brilliant minds that couldnt put statements ive said over and over ofe me out righ mentioning "my studio" was not enough of a hint. they decided to leak private facebook (fortunately nothing nda breaking), calling my house, my irl friends it was psycho. 3 more leaks happened from eith copycats or others and i am 100% that all the misinfo proven false by people that have retal switch 2 were a result of a DW moment faced with nintendos sdk nda, mark my words they are going to be procecuted. i didnt speak with noa but i can read inbetween cear lines. people are just fucking stupid in the modding community now. as a formmer modder turned legit dev it would be irresposible to associate with modding from this point knowing all of this reguardless of contractual obligations. this is not the old modding community and comming from me thats saying alot becuase ive been apart of it for 20 fucking years. well now the number has stopped increasing as i was trying to be the voice of reason, ive never failed at anything harder in my entire life. however this smells like a hack. ive been fighting constant account breach attempts for months before due to gaslighting form stupid people.

i didnt leave my love for zelda, did not leave my aspirations to create works that better peoples lives, i simply left a commubity that lost their fucking minds.

with that said i will say one thing, apart was nver just an n64 game. the pc and console version will now be the priority and now that theres 0 hombrew verion planned i think more nintendo fans may be able to enjoy it on a legal nintendo method, if things go to plan. i feel like i wasted my time but i do see regular videos of people playing things i worked on, some know i did, some 0 know i did, but thats the fun as the creator isnt the star the game/mod is.
